# Task App

Simple React application to practice utilizing state. This application allows the user to add, edit and delete tasks.

This React application was written with class components, as hooks and functional components are introduced later in the curriculum. While most new React development is moving to functional components, I thought it was a good idea to get comfortable dealing with class components in case I end up working on legacy code written with class components.
